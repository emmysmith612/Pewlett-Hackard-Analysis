# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis 
## Module 7 Challenge 

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to create a Database for Pewlett Hackard, in order to provide information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently working at the company. With this data Pewlett Hackard will be able to prepare a plan to hire new staff, and to prepare a mentorship program. The base criteria to build out these tables included employees who were born between the years 1952 & 1955. 
### Results 
•	After conducting the analysis, it is clear there are currently many employees who would be considered almost ready for retirement based off the base criteria that was set. 

•	These employees also fall into the category of holding senior positions within the company. 

•	These same senior positions are also amongst the employees that would qualify to become members of the mentorship program. 

•	All in all, we can gather that Senior staff out numbers the general staff significantly. 

##  Summary 
Based off the information conducted in our analysis it is clear Pewlett Hackard could potentially face a serious staffing shortage due to the number of Senior employees getting ready for retirement. In order to combat such a shortage Pewllett Hackard will most likely need to begin a massive hiring process in the up coming years. However, with there being a large number of Senior employees that are eligible for the mentorship program this should provide a cushion with training new employees being brought into the company.
